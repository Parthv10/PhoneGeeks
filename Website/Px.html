					<p><br> <br> <br> <br>The Pixel and Pixel XL represent a new approach to hardware for Google, and while they're not perfect, what they do, they do extremely well. An excellent camera, intuitive Google Assistant, lightning fast experience, the latest hardware and good battery life result in arguably two of the best Android smartphones ever made.</p>

		<p> Fans of the Nexus range, you can now wince as Google’s iconic Nexus range is dead. However, if you’re interested in the Pure Android experience as Google imagines it, you need not worry as the Google Pixel and Pixel XL bring with them many of the same characteristics.
<br> <br>Offering a Pure Android experience coupled with the new AI-based Google Assistant, does the Pixel XL have enough to stand out against a plethora of smartphones, both running Android and not? Will the generic design deter users away from Google’s flagship or should you look past it to any goodies that may lie within? </br>
<br>With the Galaxy Note 7 now consigned to an early death, are the Pixel and Pixel XL the perfect replacement? Let’s find out in this, our Google Pixel and Pixel XL review.
		</div>

	</div>	
	<div class="container">
	<h2><b>Design</b></h2>
	<img src="img/PXDesign.jpg" alt="design" style="width:1150px;height:676px;">
	<p><br>Let’s address the elephant in the room – the Pixel XL is basically the closest you’ll ever come to an iPhone running Android. Somewhere in Cupertino, there’s likely to be a team of lawyers pouring over Google’s latest flagship and looking at every patent, which is likely what Google did when coming up with this design. </p>
	<p>By way of comparison, the Nexus line-up has always offered quirky, unique designs (though sometimes closely inspired by Google’s partner OEMs designs) that stood out amongst a sea of competition, and the generic design of the Pixel XL removes this. The front especially doesn’t stand out at all, and you could easily mistake it for another generic smartphone, especially with the bottom chin beneath the display essentially being wasted space.</p>
	<img src="img/PXDesign2.jpg" alt="design" style="width:1150px;height:676px;">
	<p><br>Because this is a rounded, glass phone, it’s also quite slippery. HTC thankfully includes a clear plastic case in the box though, so perhaps this isn’t the biggest issue for folks who like to protect their devices. One other thing that case is good for: protecting against fingerprints. The U11 is an absolute fingerprint magnet, so keep that in mind if you’re worried about your phone looking smudgy.</p>
	<p> On the back, there’s a combination of a matte metal finish and a glossy plastic finish in the upper half of the back, and it’s an eclectic combination, which leaves a lot to the imagination. The matte part of the finish provides welcome grip while the glossy part adds one of the few elements that make the Pixel XL stand out. The back also houses the fingerprint sensor, which is rather snappy but more on that later, and Google’s G logo, which replaces the Nexus logo of old. </p>
	<img src="img/PXDesign3.jpg" alt="design" style="width:1150px;height:676px;">
	<p> Moving around the rest of the phone and on the right, you’ve got the power and volume buttons, which are quite stiff, yet easy to press. On the left, you’ve got the single SIM card tray and for those used to dual SIM and/or microSD card expansion on other Android phones, neither of these is available on the Pixel XL. Up top is the headphone jack while at the bottom is the USB Type-C port, single speaker and microphone.</p>
	<p> The build of the Pixel XL leaves a lot to be desired for me; despite not being dropped at all since I’ve had it, there are a few dents on the body already and a couple of scratches as well. In a bid to ensure the software and camera elements are great, it does seem that Google has cut corners with the design, at least in my opinion, and honestly, I wouldn’t expect these concerns from a flagship, let alone one that costs as much as the Pixel XL does.</p>
	<p> it’s not flashy and it doesn’t seem attractive to a lot of people, until you turn it on and a lot of goodness comes out of it.</p>
	<p> Say what you like, the Nexus range could always be relied upon to offer a unique experience and if Google is opting for generic designs for the Pixel range going forward, this could pose a rather big problem. Many would say the iPhone has a generic design but that’s actually become a big strength and from generic, it’s now become iconic. It remains to be seen whether the Pixel XL design language in its current form can become iconic but from my time with the handset, I think Google needs to tweak it at least a bit more with the next generation. As Josh puts it, it’s not flashy and it doesn’t seem attractive to a lot of people, until you turn it on and a lot of goodness comes out of it.</p>
	<h2><b>Display</b></h2>
	<img src="img/PXDisplay.jpg" alt="design" style="width:1150px;height:676px;">
	<p><br>The main difference between the smaller Pixel and the larger Pixel XL is the display, with the larger handset sporting a 5.5-inch Quad HD AMOLED display. Sporting 2560×1440 resolution and a pixel density of 534 pixels per inch, it’s a bright, vibrant panel that’s a joy to use, even in outdoor conditions. Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection also helps to protect the handset so the display should survive a bump or two, even if the actual build may look worse for wear.</p>
	<p>Running the Pixel XL’s AMOLED display through our display tests reveals a slightly cooler color temperature of 7859 Kelvin, which essentially means the screen has a blue tint. Interestingly, at least according to our spectrophotometer readings, the when the display is set to the standard mode (rather than the default adaptive mode), it scores 7131k, which is much more accurate compared to the recommended temperature of 6500k.</p>
	<p> Anything you want to do on this phone, you won’t be disappointed.</p>
	<p> A max brightness of 420 nits, even under direct light, doesn’t quite tell the full story as although the Pixel XL has a lower max brightness than other devices, there are no noticeable legibility issues in direct sunlight. Overall, I’d have to agree with Lanh when he says anything you want to do on this phone, you won’t be disappointed.</p>
	<h2><b>Performance</b></h2>
	<img src="img/PXPerformance.jpg" alt="design" style="width:1150px;height:676px;">
	<p><br> Under the hood, the Pixel XL is powered by the latest Snapdragon 821 chipset – which features 2 high-power Kryo cores at 2.15GHz and 2 high-efficiency cores at 1.6GHz) alongside 4GB of RAM and an Adreno 530 GPU. With this package, the Pixel XL is mostly future proof, at least until Qualcomm’s next flagship chipset – expected to be the Snapdragon 830 – which landed early this year</p>
	<h2><b>Hardware</b></h2>
	<img src="img/PXhardware.jpg" alt="design" style="width:1150px;height:676px;">
	<p><br> On the hardware front, the Pixel XL definitely seems to be on par with most flagships, save for the lack of microSD card expansion. There’s two storage options – 32GB and 128GB – and while you do get unlimited full resolution uploads to Google Photos with either Pixel, you’ll likely want to grab the 128GB version. In just 10 days, I’ve managed to use up 25GB of the 29.7GB available out of the box albeit this was without having backups to Google Photos turned on.<p>
	<p> Having full uploads to Google Photos enabled coupled with automatic backups when connected to WiFi and charging makes it rather simple to always ensure the images have been synced to Google’s servers. When you do run low on space, Assistant’s Free Up Space feature checks which images on your phones have been backed up and can then delete them from local storage to free up space. As long as you’ve got an internet connection, you’ll still be able to see and access those images in the Photos app, but it’s quite slow, especially on a mobile data connection.</p>
	<img src="img/PXHardware2.jpg" alt="design" style="width:1150px;height:676px;">
	<h2><b>Camera</b></h2>
	<img src="img/PXCamera.jpg" alt="design" style="width:1150px;height:676px;">
	<p>At the launch of the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google focused on five key selling points for its flagship handsets, with the camera one of the key messages. Google claims the Pixel XL has the highest DxOMark rating for any smartphone (with a score of 89) but as we’ve seen previously, it doesn’t always reflect what’s most pleasing to the eye. As it stands, the Pixel XL camera definitely seems to live up to Google’s claims, mostly.</p>
	<h2><b>Pricing and final thoughts</b></h2>
	<img src="img/PXConclusion.jpg" alt="design" style="width:1150px;height:676px;">
	<p><br>There’s no doubt that if you want the Pixel or the Pixel XL, you’ll definitely be paying a premium for having access to Google’s latest experience. The question you’re probably asking right now is – should you buy either?</p>
	<p> Personally, I’m torn as they’re both great phones and the compromises are few and far between, but the biggest is the price tag. On paper, it doesn’t quite offer as much as other flagship devices but what it does do, it does exceptionally well. The camera makes it easy for anyone to take incredible photos in a pinch while Google Assistant is excellent, when it’s not trolling you that is. If money is no object, then you can’t go wrong with either of Google’s new smartphones.</p>
	<p> It’s a new direction for Google but it’s worked and if you want the best from Google, the Pixel phones are what you’re getting for 2016; they won’t disappoint you as they are possibly, two of the best Android smartphones ever made. As the first generation of Google’s new approach to hardware, they give us a lot to look forward to and we’re all excited to see how much better its going to get from here.</p>
