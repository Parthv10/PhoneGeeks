					<p><br> <br> <br> <br>The Galaxy S7 Edge takes everything we loved about the S6 Edge and infuses it with several coats of polish, creating what is one of the most gorgeous and powerful phones we’ve ever seen. As extra icing on the cake, Samsung has also brought back microSD expansion and water resistance – two features missing from its predecessor. Bottom-line, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge might not drastically change the formula started by its predecessor, but it certainly does perfect it.</p>

		<p> After years of criticism for its stubborn refusal to move past its plastic-clad design language, last year we finally saw a new Samsung emerge with the introduction of the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. Trading in the tired plastic rear backing, the new Galaxy S6 family brought us a metallic frame sandwiched between a glass front and back. Though the Galaxy S6 was a stunning device, the star of the show was arguably the S6 Edge, which featured a unique dual curved design that helped it stand apart from other devices on the market.</p>

	<h2><b>Design</b></h2>
	<img src="img/s7 desgin.jpg" alt="design" style="width:1150px;height:676px;">
	
	<p><br>The most immediate difference you’ll notice between the Galaxy S7 Edge and its predecessor is the phone’s size. Bridging the size gap between last year’s Galaxy S6 Edge and the S6 Edge Plus, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge offers a 5.5-inch display, making it noticeably larger than the “standard” Galaxy S7. Talking with Lanh, we both agreed that the jump up in real estate was a positive move, giving you more screen real estate for all your gaming and media consumption needs. Sure, the phone takes a small hit when it comes to one-handed usability, but thanks to the way that the Edge curves down, it’s really not as big of a difference as you might think. </p>
	<p>Aside from the larger display, the Galaxy S7 Edge looks very similar to its predecessor, though Samsung has managed to sneak in a few adjustments to the design. First, the camera is bump has been noticeably reduced when compared to the S6 Edge. The camera still protrudes a little, but at less than a half millimeter, it’s going to be a lot less bothersome than the camera bump on its predecessor.</p>
	<p>Next, the S7 Edge is marginally thicker than both the S6 Edge and S6 Edge Plus at 7.7mm, vs the Edge Plus at 6.9mm and the Edge at 7mm. That might sound like a bad thing, but the added thickness actually helps with grip. As an added bonus, this thicker profile also means Samsung was able to cram in a larger battery, which will talk more about a bit later in the review. Probably the most helpful design change found on the Galaxy S7 Edge, however, is the curved glass backing that helps alleviate some of the ‘sharpness’ issues some users reported with the original Galaxy S6 Edge.</p>
	<p>On the bottom, you’ll find the headphone jack to the left, the microUSB slot in the middle, and the single speaker to the right. The microUSB slot is probably the most interesting story here, not because it’s anything special or new, but because Samsung is sticking to its guns with the Galaxy S7 Edge has chosen not to adopt the new USB-C standard.</p>
	<p>Bottom-line, the Galaxy S7 Edge might not look dramatically different from its predecessor, but little touches like a great feel in the hand, help create what is easily one of the most attractive looking handsets in the mobile world.</p>
	<h2><b>Display</b></h2>
	<img src="img/s7 display.jpg" alt="design" style="width:1150px;height:676px;">
	<p><br>When it comes to display quality, it’s hard to beat Samsung, and thankfully the S7 Edge continues this legacy. While the S7 Edge’s Super AMOLED display remains very similar to the screen found on the S6 Edge, Samsung did bump up the size this time around, going from 5.1-inches to 5.5-inches. While this results in a lower pixel density of 534 ppi vs 577ppi on the Galaxy S6 Edge, the real world difference is negligible and if anything, the larger size means a better experience for watching movies, playing games, and pretty much anything else you might want to do.</p>
	<p>Everything we love about AMOLED tech is present here in the S7 Edge, including vibrant, saturated colors, great viewing angles, inky dark blacks, and brightness that’s more than good enough even when using the phone outdoors. Comparing it to the AMOLED display on my Nexus 6P, I have to admit that the Edge display looked way better, especially outdoors. That said, the brightness controls (auto adjusting, etc) were a bit more aggressive than the 6P, and required me to manually move the slider a bit more than I normally do, but this was not really anything that bothered me too much.</p>
	<p>One change found on the Galaxy S7 Edge over the S6 Edge is the new “always on display”. While this is really more of a software feature than anything new with the hardware, we still felt it was worth talking about here. In a nutshell, the always on display gives you glanceable information such as the time, if you have any messages or missed calls, and there’s even options to display a calendar or even a picture/pattern. This is somewhat similar to what you’ll find on Motorola devices and modern Nexus family members, but the difference is that the illumination is constant with the S7 Edge and not just intermittent like with the former devices.</p>
	<p>For those wondering about how the feature affects battery life, I found that on the day I had it disabled, I may have had a few extra percentage points of battery left when I went to bed over what I normally would have had. That’s not the most technical test I realize, but it’s pretty obvious to me that it doesn’t make a big difference and that’s down to just how energy efficient AMOLED displays are, especially when only needing to light a very small portion of the display.</p>
	<p>Bottom-line, the display here is a good one and the always on display tech is a nice addition, though it may not be that useful for everyone. The good news is if you don’t think the always on display is something you’ll use, Samsung makes it easy to disable.</p>
	<h2><b>Camera</b></h2>
	<img src="img/s7 camera.jpg" alt="design" style="width:1150px;height:676px;">
	<p><br> While Samsung has always done a pretty good job when it comes to camera quality in its smartphones, in 2015 we really saw Samsung up its game bringing us one of the best camera experiences ever to grace a mobile device. Instead of keeping the same package or just updating it slightly, Samsung has decided to take a different route with the Galaxy S7 Edge, opting for a 12MP camera instead of the 16MP shooter found in its predecessor.</p>
	<p>Of course there’s more to a great camera experience than just megapixels. While the count may be lower, this has allowed for much larger pixels for increased low-light performance, in a move similar to what we saw from Huawei and Google with the Nexus 6P. The camera on the Galaxy S7 also has an f/1.7 aperture lens, a change from the f/1.9 aperture found in its predecessor. Some of the camera’s other features include optical image stabilization, phase detection autofocus, LED flash, and dual pixel technology. The end result is a camera with noticeably faster autofocus over competing flagship smartphones, especially in low light.</p>
	<p>HDR mode is quite subtle with the Galaxy S7 Edge’s camera, and isn’t as aggressive as many other smartphone cameras out there, and that’s probably a good thing really. That said, it works well enough in bringing back more detail from the shadows and brightly lit areas of the photos.</p>
	<p>As for video recording, there’s plenty of modes here, including the ability to take 4K videos and OIS to help footage from getting too shaky. Keep in mind that there is also optional software video stabilization, but it cause a lot of warping in the footage and so you’re better off not using it.</p>
