		<p><br> <br> <br> <br>The Moto G4 Plus brings with it a slew of much needed improvements to the Moto G range, and while there are some questionable design choices, this is definitely an impressive smartphone for the price.</p>
		<br>

		<br>

		<p>The original Moto G – released back in 2013 – was one of the first smartphones that kicked of the trend of affordable but high quality smartphones, and went on to become one of the best-selling Motorola smartphones ever. Motorola has continued to release a successor every year since then, but with a lot more OEMs offering options in this ever-growing category, Motorola did have to do something different with the forth generation of their affordable mid-range smartphone. </p>
		<p>That something different arrived in the four of three variations of the latest Moto G, with the Moto G4 Play, the Moto G4, and the Moto G4 Plus, that come with varying display sizes, processing packages, camera setups, and other hardware features, with the latter being the highest-end of the lot. While more expensive when compared to its siblings, the Moto G4 Plus remains extremely affordable, and tacks on a few extras that ultimately make it far more compelling to users.</p>

	<h2><b>Design</b></h2>
	<img src="img/moto design.jpg" alt="design" style="width:1150px;height:676px;">
	
	<p><br>HTC has always had a penchant for beautiful design and solid build quality, so it’s no surprise to see the U11 excels in this area. Instead of a metal construction like it normally employs on its high-end offerings, HTC has opted for metal and glass with the U11. The device features rounded corners, curved edges on the front and back, and an aluminium frame sandwiched between two glass panels. This all makes for a seamless, comfortable in-hand feel. </p>
	<p>This design language is something we’ve seen numerous times now, but what makes the U11 stand out is the liquid glass surface on the back. This design is bound to turn heads, and the way to color shifts and changes depending on the angle results in a stunning effect.</p>
	<img src="img/Design 1.jpg" alt="design" style="width:1150px;height:676px;">
	<p><br>Because this is a rounded, glass phone, it’s also quite slippery. HTC thankfully includes a clear plastic case in the box though, so perhaps this isn’t the biggest issue for folks who like to protect their devices. One other thing that case is good for: protecting against fingerprints. The U11 is an absolute fingerprint magnet, so keep that in mind if you’re worried about your phone looking smudgy.</p>
	<h2><b>Display</b></h2>
	<img src="img/Display.jpg" alt="design" style="width:1150px;height:676px;">
	<p><br>While most other companies are going for taller and narrower display in 2017 (Samsung, LG, and Essential, just to name a few), HTC has gone with a more traditional, familiar display on the U11. The device comes with a 5.5-inch Quad HD Super LCD 5 display, with a “normal” 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>
	<p>The bezels around the display are pretty thick. Although it doesn’t affect how you’ll use the phone, the front of the U11 just seems sort of dated compared to the Galaxy S8 and LG G6.</p>
<p>The quality of the screen itself is fantastic. It’s sharp, crisp, has excellent viewing angles, and vibrant colors. Outdoor visibility isn’t an issue, though I do wish the display was able to get much dimmer. It feels a bit too bright when using it at night or in the dark, but that’s only a minor complaint for what’s otherwise a great display experience.</p>
	<h2><b>Performance</b></h2>
	<img src="img/Performance.jpg" alt="design" style="width:1150px;height:676px;">
	<p><br>In terms of specifications and hardware, the U11 ticks all the right boxes. Under the hood is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor backed by 4 GB of RAM, and overall performance is just as fast and fluid as you would expect.</p>
	<p>Touch response and scrolling is excellent and it runs apps and high-end games with no issues at all. Multi-tasking is also nice and quick, but I did notice that the RAM management is quite aggressive with the device sometimes closing apps after opening only five or six of them. While that isn’t a big deal for me, it’s still something worth noting.</p>
	<h2><b>Hardware</b></h2>
	<img src="img/hardware.jpg" alt="design" style="width:1150px;height:676px;">
	<p><br>The U11 in the United States comes with 64 GB of on-board storage, which you can expand up to an additional 256 GB via microSD. There’s also a global variant of the device that comes with 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage. That’s great news for folks outside the U.S., though we wish the higher-end model was available for everyone.<p>
	<p>The U11 features the same woofer and tweeter combo that we first saw with the HTC 10, but it has been improved significantly this time around. It is much louder and with better clarity, and HTC is leveraging the entire phone as an acoustic chamber to make this happen. You can literally feel the audio resonate through the device when holding it in your hand, and there is a huge difference in audio quality and volume when listening to the U11 and HTC 10 side by side.</p>
	<img src="img/Hardware 1.jpg" alt="design" style="width:1150px;height:676px;">
	<h2><b>Camera</b></h2>
	<p>When HTC announced the U11, one of the biggest topics of discussion was the device’s camera. The company was eager to tell us that the U11 has the highest DxOMark score of all time, outranking the Pixel and Galaxy S8 by one and two points, respectively.</p>
	<p>The U11’s main camera comes with a 12 MP “UltraPixel 3” sensor, with an f/1.7 aperture and optical image stabilization. Overall, the U11’s camera lives up to the hype and is capable of taking some impressive photos. There’s plenty of detail in each shot, and color reproduction is natural and not overly vibrant.</p>
	<img src="img/camera.jpg" alt="design" style="width:1150px;height:600px;">
	<p><br>Photos taken in low-light conditions are incredibly sharp and well detailed, too. Noise levels are kept under control, and the noise you do see is very fine and compact. Low light photos aren’t splotchy at all, which is something we don’t see too often in smartphone cameras.</p>
	<p>Although this is a new sensor, it does suffer from one issue in low-light situations that we also saw with the U Ultra. Highlights are very heavily overblown and snapping photos that have light sources causes a lot of streaking, lens flares, and floating light particles. This was also a pretty big problem with the U Ultra, which is why I believe this might be caused by the phone’s reflective back. If that is the case, there isn’t really a permanent fix for it, other than using a case. Still, it’s not an issue many people will find to be bothersome.</p>
	<p>The front-facing camera no longer comes with OIS like the HTC 10 did, but you are getting a much higher resolution 16 MP unit for capturing better and sharper looking selfies. Both the rear and front cameras are also leveraging a new feature dubbed HDR Boost, which auto-processes as HDR to give you the clearest and most well-balanced photo possible, similar to what Google has done with the Pixel.</p>
	<h2>Pricing and final thoughts</h2>
	<img src="img/pricing.jpg" alt="design" style="width:1150px;height:676px;">
	<p><br>At $649, the U11 is certainly more reasonable than the U Ultra ($749) and the Galaxy S8 ($725). It isn’t an overpriced phone by any means, but it certainly falls outside of impulse buy territory.</p>
